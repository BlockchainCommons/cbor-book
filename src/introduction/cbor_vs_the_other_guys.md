# CBOR vs. The Other Guys

## The Binary Serialization Landscape

In the previous chapter, we traced the evolution of data interchange formats from the structured but verbose world of XML to the simpler, web-centric realm of JSON. This journey highlighted a recurring theme: the constant search for better ways to represent and exchange data, driven by changing technological needs. JSON's simplicity and performance advantages over XML made it dominant for web APIs. However, its text-based nature presented limitations in scenarios demanding maximum efficiency, particularly concerning size and processing speed. This led to the development of CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation), designed to retain the familiar JSON data model while leveraging the power of binary encoding for compactness and performance, especially crucial in constrained environments like the Internet of Things (IoT).

CBOR, however, does not exist in isolation. It is part of a larger landscape of binary serialization formats, each created with specific goals and trade-offs. Understanding how CBOR compares to "the other guys" is essential for appreciating its unique strengths and making informed decisions about which format best suits a given application. This chapter surveys several prominent binary formats, comparing them with CBOR across various dimensions. We will examine:

- [BSON (Binary JSON)](https://bsonspec.org/): Developed by MongoDB as an internal storage and wire format, extending the JSON model with database-centric types and optimizing for traversability.

- [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/): Google's high-performance, schema-driven format primarily designed for efficient Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and data archival.

- [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/): Another format aiming to be a fast and compact binary alternative to JSON, often used for network communication and caching.

- [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/): An Apache project emphasizing robust schema evolution capabilities, commonly found in big data ecosystems like Hadoop and Kafka.

Our comparison will focus on their origins and motivations, core data models, encoding strategies, approaches to schemas and validation, performance characteristics (size and speed), extensibility mechanisms, and typical use cases.

A fundamental distinction within this binary landscape lies between formats that are **schema-optional** (or typically used schema-less) like CBOR, BSON, and MessagePack, and those that are **schema-driven** like Protocol Buffers and Avro. Schema-optional formats generally embed type information alongside the data, allowing them to be parsed without prior knowledge of the structure, much like JSON. This offers flexibility but can introduce some overhead and necessitates runtime validation if structure enforcement is needed. Conversely, schema-driven formats rely on an external schema (e.g., a `.proto` file for Protobuf or a JSON definition for Avro) known by both sender and receiver. This allows for potentially more compact encodings (as field names and types might be omitted from the wire format) and enables compile-time or inherent validation, but it necessitates schema management and reduces the self-describing nature of the data. This core difference often stems from the formats' origins â€“ whether they were designed for flexible document storage like BSON or for high-performance, predefined message structures like Protobuf. Understanding this division is key to appreciating the trade-offs inherent in each format.

## BSON: Binary JSON Tailored for Databases

Binary JSON, or BSON, emerged directly from the needs of the MongoDB NoSQL database. While MongoDB aimed to be JSON-first, leveraging its developer familiarity and flexible document model, raw JSON proved suboptimal for internal database operations. Key limitations included JSON's restricted set of data types (lacking native support for dates or binary data) and the inefficiencies of parsing text and traversing variable-length fields for database queries and indexing.

BSON was invented to bridge this gap, providing a binary representation of JSON-like documents optimized for MongoDB's specific requirements: efficient storage, fast data traversal and scanning, and enhanced type support, while retaining JSON's schema flexibility. It became MongoDB's native format for both data storage and network transfer.

### Design and Encoding

BSON serializes documents as binary data, encoding type and length information for each element. A BSON document starts with a 4-byte integer specifying the total document size, followed by a sequence of elements, and ending with a null byte. Each element consists of a type code (a single byte), a null-terminated field name (key), and the element's value encoded according to its type. This structure, particularly the inclusion of length prefixes for elements like strings and sub-documents, allows MongoDB to traverse documents and access specific fields quickly without parsing the entire structure.

Crucially, BSON extends the basic JSON data model with several types essential for database operations :

- **ObjectId:** A 12-byte unique identifier commonly used as a primary key, composed of a timestamp, machine identifier, process ID, and counter.

- **Date:** A 64-bit integer representing milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

- **Binary Data (BinData):** Allows embedding arbitrary byte arrays directly, along with a subtype indicator, avoiding the need for Base64 encoding typical in JSON.

- **Timestamp:** A special 64-bit internal type used primarily for MongoDB replication logs (oplog), containing seconds since epoch and an incrementing ordinal.

- **Additional Numeric Types:** Includes distinct types for 32-bit integers (`int32`), 64-bit integers (`int64`), 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point numbers (`double`), and a 128-bit high-precision decimal format (`Decimal128`) important for financial applications.

- **Deprecated Types:** Includes types like `Undefined` which are generally discouraged.

One notable, and often criticized, design choice is the encoding of arrays. BSON arrays are represented as standard BSON documents where the keys are strings representing the array indices ("0", "1", "2", etc.). While this simplifies the internal representation (everything is a document), it adds significant overhead compared to more direct array encodings, especially for large arrays.

BSON's design prioritizes traversability and the ability to perform in-place updates. The length prefixes facilitate skipping fields during reads, and the fixed-size encoding of some numeric types can simplify modifying values within a stored document without rewriting the entire object.

### Pros and Cons

BSON's strengths lie in its tight integration with MongoDB. It enables faster scanning and traversal of documents compared to parsing JSON text. Its support for richer data types like dates, binary data, ObjectIds, and high-precision decimals is crucial for database functionality. It retains the schema flexibility of JSON, and its structure allows MongoDB to build indexes on fields within documents, enabling efficient querying.

However, BSON also has drawbacks. The inclusion of type and length prefixes, along with the verbose array encoding, means BSON documents can be larger than their JSON counterparts, especially for smaller documents. It is generally less space-efficient than other binary formats like MessagePack or Protobuf. Like most binary formats, it is not directly human-readable. Its extended types make lossless conversion to standard JSON impossible in some cases, limiting interoperability. Its use is heavily concentrated within the MongoDB ecosystem, and it lacks built-in support for RPC mechanisms.

### Comparison vs. CBOR

Both CBOR and BSON are schema-optional binary formats derived from the JSON data model. However, their design goals diverge significantly. BSON is optimized for database storage and efficient traversal, incorporating length prefixes and database-specific types like `ObjectId` and `Decimal128`. This optimization can come at the cost of compactness. CBOR, conversely, prioritizes conciseness and implementation simplicity for network transmission, particularly in constrained environments. CBOR generally achieves smaller message sizes than BSON. While BSON has database-centric types, CBOR uses a more general base type system extended via a standardized tag mechanism (e.g., for dates, bignums). Furthermore, BSON is intrinsically linked to MongoDB, whereas CBOR is an IETF standard (RFC 8949) used across various internet protocols.

The design choices embedded in BSON clearly reflect its primary purpose: serving as an efficient internal format for MongoDB. The need for fast field access within stored documents led to length prefixes, and the requirements of database operations dictated the inclusion of types like `Date`, `BinData`, and `ObjectId`. These adaptations mean BSON is more than just a binary encoding _of_ JSON; it's an _extended_ format tailored for a specific database environment. This specialization yields benefits within MongoDB but results in trade-offs regarding size and general-purpose interoperability compared to formats optimized purely for transmission or broader applicability. The name "Binary JSON" can thus be slightly misleading, as lossless round-tripping with standard JSON is not always possible due to the extended types.

## Protocol Buffers: Schema-Driven Performance

Protocol Buffers, commonly known as Protobuf, originated within Google as a language-neutral, platform-neutral, and extensible mechanism for serializing structured data. Developed initially for internal use, particularly to improve the efficiency of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) and for archival data storage, it was designed to be smaller, faster, and simpler than XML. Google open-sourced Protobuf in 2008, making it widely available.

### Design and Encoding

Protobuf takes a fundamentally different approach from JSON, BSON, or CBOR: it is **schema-driven**. Data structures, called "messages," must be defined in special definition files with a `.proto` extension using Protobuf's Interface Definition Language (IDL).

A key part of the Protobuf workflow involves the protocol buffer compiler, `protoc`. This tool processes `.proto` files and generates source code in various target languages (like C++, Java, Python, Go, C#, etc.). This generated code provides classes or structures corresponding to the defined messages, along with methods for setting/getting field values, serializing messages to binary format, and parsing binary data back into objects.

The Protobuf binary wire format is designed for compactness and speed. Instead of field names, each field defined in the `.proto` schema is assigned a unique **field number** (also called a tag number). These numbers, along with a **wire type** indicating how the field's value is encoded, are used as keys in the binary stream. The wire type tells the parser how much data to read for the value (e.g., `VARINT` for variable-length integers, `I64` for fixed 64-bit values, `LEN` for length-delimited data like strings, bytes, or embedded messages, `I32` for fixed 32-bit values).

Protobuf employs efficient encoding techniques. Integers are often encoded using **Varints**, which use fewer bytes for smaller numbers. Negative integers can be encoded using **ZigZag encoding** (for `sint32`/`sint64` types), which is more efficient for small negative numbers than standard two's complement representation when using Varints.

The data model supports various scalar types (e.g., `int32`, `int64`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `sint32`, `sint64`, `bool`, `enum`, `fixed64`, `sfixed64`, `double`, `string`, `bytes`, `fixed32`, `sfixed32`, `float`), nested message types, `repeated` fields (effectively arrays or lists), and `map` fields (key-value pairs). It also supports `oneof`, allowing a message to contain at most one field from a specified set.

Protobuf offers good support for **schema evolution**. As long as field numbers are not reused or changed for existing fields, developers can typically add new optional or repeated fields or remove existing optional or repeated fields without breaking backward or forward compatibility. Parsers encountering unknown field numbers simply skip them. Changing the type of an existing field is generally not safe. Using `required` fields was part of earlier versions but is now discouraged because removing a required field breaks compatibility.

### Pros and Cons

Protobuf's primary advantages stem from its schema-driven design. It typically achieves high performance (fast serialization/deserialization) and results in very compact message sizes, largely because field names are replaced by numeric tags. The use of a schema and generated code provides compile-time type safety and simplifies data access. Its schema evolution capabilities allow systems to change over time without immediately breaking communication. Being language-neutral with broad code generation support makes it suitable for polyglot environments.

However, the reliance on schemas is also the source of its disadvantages. Protobuf data is not self-describing; the `.proto` schema definition is required to interpret the binary data correctly. The binary format is not human-readable. The workflow requires an extra step: compiling `.proto` files and managing the generated code. This makes it less flexible than schema-less formats for applications dealing with dynamic or unpredictable data structures. While efficient for many things, it's noted as potentially suboptimal for very large messages (exceeding a few megabytes) or large multi-dimensional arrays of numbers common in scientific computing. Lastly, while a de facto standard widely used by Google and others, it is not formalized by a body like the IETF or W3C.

### Comparison vs. CBOR

The most significant difference lies in their approach to schemas. Protobuf _requires_ a schema (`.proto` file) and a compilation step. CBOR is fundamentally **schema-optional**; its data is self-describing, containing type indicators within the binary stream, much like JSON. While CBOR can be used with schema languages like [CDDL](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8610) for validation, the schema is not needed for basic parsing.

This leads to differences in self-description (CBOR yes, Protobuf no), encoding strategy (CBOR uses type indicators and often encodes map keys as strings, Protobuf uses numeric field tags and wire types), flexibility (CBOR is higher due to being schema-optional, Protobuf is more rigid but safer), and extensibility (CBOR uses IANA-registered tags, Protobuf uses options or extensions defined within the `.proto` system).

Performance comparisons are nuanced. Protobuf is often highly optimized for speed and size, especially in RPC scenarios where schemas are pre-shared. CBOR also aims for efficiency, with a particular focus on minimizing codec implementation size for constrained devices. Actual results depend heavily on the data, implementation quality, and use case. In terms of standardization, CBOR is an IETF standard (RFC 8949), while Protobuf remains a Google-driven de facto standard.

Protobuf embodies a design philosophy where performance, compactness, and type safety are achieved _through_ the mandatory use of schemas and code generation. This approach is highly effective in controlled environments like Google's internal infrastructure, where managing and distributing schemas is feasible. The tight coupling of schema, generated code, and binary format yields significant efficiency gains. However, this comes at the cost of the flexibility, self-description, and schema independence offered by formats like JSON or CBOR. The trade-off is clear: Protobuf prioritizes performance and structural rigidity via schemas, whereas CBOR prioritizes flexibility and self-description while still offering binary efficiency.

## MessagePack: The Compact JSON Alternative

MessagePack emerged around 2008-2009, created by Sadayuki Furuhashi. Its explicit goal was to be a more efficient binary serialization format compared to JSON â€“ essentially, "like JSON, but fast and small". It was conceived primarily for scenarios where JSON's verbosity was a bottleneck, such as network communication (RPC, message queues) and caching data (e.g., in Memcached).

### Design and Encoding

MessagePack defines a binary format that closely mirrors the fundamental data types found in JSON: null, boolean, integer, floating-point number, string, array, and map (associative array). It aims for high compatibility, allowing data to be transparently converted between MessagePack and JSON where the data models overlap.

Beyond the basic JSON types, MessagePack adds native support for:

- **`bin` (Binary Data):** Allows efficient storage of raw byte sequences.

- **`ext` (Extension Type):** Provides a mechanism for embedding application-specific types. An `ext` value consists of an integer type code (tag) and a byte string payload containing the custom data.

The encoding strategy focuses on compactness. Small integer values (positive and negative) can be encoded in a single byte. Short strings require only a small prefix indicating the length, followed by the raw UTF-8 bytes. Arrays and maps are prefixed with their size (number of elements or key-value pairs). Unlike JSON, MessagePack allows any data type to be used as a map key, not just strings. Data types and lengths are typically indicated by the initial byte(s) of the encoded value.

### Pros and Cons

MessagePack's main advantage is its potential for greater efficiency compared to JSON. It generally produces smaller serialized output due to its binary nature and optimized encodings for common types. This compactness can lead to faster network transmission and reduced storage requirements. Serialization and deserialization can also be faster than with standard JSON libraries, although performance heavily depends on the specific implementations and data being processed. It supports native binary data and offers an extension mechanism for custom types. Implementations are available for a wide variety of programming languages.

However, MessagePack is not human-readable, making debugging more difficult than with JSON. A significant potential drawback relates to streaming: because arrays and maps require their element count to be encoded upfront, it can be difficult or impossible to serialize them in a streaming fashion if the total count is not known beforehand. This might necessitate buffering the entire collection in memory before serialization. While performance gains over JSON are often cited, highly optimized JSON libraries exist, and the actual benefit can be context-dependent. Compared to CBOR, MessagePack lacks formal standardization through bodies like the IETF (its specification resides on GitHub), and its `ext` mechanism is less structured than CBOR's IANA-registered tags.

### Comparison vs. CBOR

CBOR and MessagePack share the goal of being efficient, schema-less binary alternatives to JSON, and both support native binary data types. However, they differ in key aspects:

- **Encoding Details:** While broadly similar, subtle differences exist. CBOR defines specific types for indefinite-length arrays and maps, which can be beneficial for streaming scenarios where the total size isn't known upfront. MessagePack typically requires fixed counts for collections.

- **Standardization:** CBOR is a formal IETF standard (RFC 8949), developed through a consensus process. MessagePack relies on a community-maintained specification. Some observers view CBOR as a more rigorously defined standard inspired by MessagePack.

- **Extensibility:** CBOR features a standardized semantic tag system with an IANA registry for common extended types (dates, URIs, bignums, etc.). MessagePack uses a more ad-hoc `ext` type, where applications define the meaning of the integer tag.

- **Performance and Size:** Direct comparisons are often inconclusive and depend heavily on the libraries and data structures used. CBOR explicitly aimed for small _codec_ size (important for constrained devices) alongside reasonable message compactness, while MessagePack's primary focus was message size and speed.

- **Conceptual Simplicity:** MessagePack's specification might appear simpler at first glance due to its length. However, CBOR's unification of many types under its major type/additional info system and its tag mechanism could be argued as conceptually cleaner.

MessagePack represents an influential early effort to create a "binary JSON," driven by the need for better network performance. Its design choices, such as requiring counts for collections, may reflect an optimization for serializing complete, known data structures rather than supporting complex streaming scenarios. Its popularity demonstrates the demand for such a format. However, its lack of formal standardization and potential limitations in streaming contrast with CBOR, which benefited from the IETF standards process, incorporating features like indefinite-length items and a standardized tag registry, arguably aiming for broader applicability, including the challenging requirements of constrained devices and diverse internet protocols.

## Avro: Mastering Schema Evolution

Apache Avro is another prominent player in the data serialization landscape, originating within the Apache Hadoop project around 2009. Its design was heavily influenced by the requirements of large-scale data processing systems. Avro's defining characteristic and primary motivation is its robust support for **schema evolution**. In environments like data pipelines built with Hadoop or Kafka, where data producers and consumers often evolve their data structures independently and at different rates, managing schema changes without breaking compatibility is paramount. Avro also aimed to provide rich data structures and easy integration with dynamic languages, notably not requiring code generation for basic serialization and deserialization.

### Design and Encoding

Avro is **schema-based**, similar to Protocol Buffers, but with distinct differences. Schemas are typically defined using JSON, making them relatively human-readable. An alternative, more C-like Avro IDL syntax is also available.

A critical aspect of Avro's design is that the schema used to _write_ the data is always required to _read_ that data. Avro data itself, in its compact binary encoding, **does not contain field names or type identifiers (tags)**. Instead, the binary data is simply a concatenation of the encoded field values, written in the exact order they are defined in the writer's schema. This makes the binary encoding very compact but entirely dependent on the schema for interpretation. To facilitate this, the writer's schema is typically stored alongside the data (e.g., in the header of Avro data files) or made available through a schema registry service. Avro also supports a JSON encoding, primarily for debugging or web contexts.

Avro supports a set of primitive types (`null`, `boolean`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `bytes`, `string`) and complex types (`record`, `enum`, `array`, `map`, `union`, `fixed`). Records contain named fields, enums define a set of symbols, arrays hold sequences of items, maps store key-value pairs (keys must be strings), fixed represents fixed-size byte sequences, and unions allow a value to be one of several specified types. Unions are commonly used to represent optional fields by including `null` as one of the types (e.g., `["null", "string"]`).

Avro's strength lies in its well-defined **schema evolution rules**, which allow for changes while maintaining compatibility (backward, forward, or full). Key rules include:

- Fields can be added or removed only if they have a default value defined in the schema. The default value is used by readers when the field is missing in the data (due to being written with an older or newer schema).

- Renaming a field is not directly supported in the writer's schema but can be handled using `aliases` in the reader's schema. The reader will recognize data written with the old name via the alias.

- Changing a field's data type is generally forbidden, although certain promotions are allowed (e.g., `int` to `long`, `float` to `double`).

- For enums, adding new symbols is backward compatible, but removing or renaming existing symbols breaks compatibility.

When a reader encounters data written with a different (but compatible) schema, Avro uses **schema resolution**. The reader provides both its own expected schema and the writer's actual schema; the Avro library then resolves the differences based on field names (and aliases) and applies default values as needed to present the data according to the reader's schema.

### Pros and Cons

Avro's main advantage is its sophisticated and robust handling of schema evolution, making it ideal for systems where schemas change frequently or independently. Its schemas, defined in JSON, are relatively easy to understand and manage. The binary encoding is compact because it omits field names and tags. Avro integrates well with dynamic languages, as code generation is not strictly required if the schema is available at runtime. It has strong adoption within the Apache big data ecosystem, particularly with tools like Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka.

The primary disadvantage is the requirement for the writer's schema to be available during deserialization. This introduces complexity related to schema management and distribution, often necessitating a schema registry. While the binary format is compact, some benchmarks suggest Avro serialization/deserialization might be slower than Protobuf in certain scenarios. The binary format is not human-readable, and developers must carefully adhere to the schema evolution rules to maintain compatibility.

### Comparison vs. CBOR

Avro and CBOR represent fundamentally different philosophies regarding schemas. Avro _requires_ schemas for reading and writing binary data, and its core design revolves around schema resolution for evolution. CBOR is **schema-optional** and self-describing; schemas (like CDDL) can be used for validation but are not needed for parsing.

This impacts encoding: Avro's binary format omits field identifiers, relying on schema field order. CBOR includes type information and typically encodes map keys, making it interpretable without an external schema.

Schema evolution is handled explicitly and robustly in Avro through resolution rules, defaults, and aliases. CBOR handles evolution more implicitly; its self-describing nature often allows parsers to skip unknown data, but complex changes might require application-level logic or conventions built around tags. CBOR offers greater flexibility for ad-hoc data structures, while Avro enforces structure through its mandatory schemas. Their ecosystems also differ, with Avro dominant in Big Data/Apache contexts and CBOR prevalent in IoT and IETF protocols.

Avro's design choices are clearly optimized for solving the schema evolution challenge inherent in large-scale, long-lived data systems. By requiring the writer's schema at read time, Avro enables powerful resolution capabilities, allowing producers and consumers to evolve more independently. This contrasts sharply with Protobuf's reliance on stable tag numbers and CBOR's schema-optional flexibility. The trade-off is explicit: Avro gains robust evolution and dynamic language integration at the cost of schema management complexity and data that is not self-contained in its binary form.

## Comparative Analysis: Choosing the Right Tool

Having examined BSON, Protocol Buffers, MessagePack, and Avro, it's clear that the binary serialization landscape offers diverse solutions tailored to different needs. BSON optimizes for MongoDB's internal operations. Protocol Buffers prioritizes performance and type safety for RPC through mandatory schemas. MessagePack aims for a simple, compact binary alternative to JSON for network communication. Avro focuses squarely on managing schema evolution in data pipelines. CBOR carves its niche by offering a standardized, binary-efficient encoding of the JSON data model, emphasizing constrained environments and extensibility.

No single format reigns supreme across all use cases. The optimal choice requires careful consideration of the specific requirements and constraints of the application. Key decision points revolve around the schema-versus-schema-less divide, performance needs versus flexibility, the importance and complexity of schema evolution, ecosystem integration, and the need for specific features like native data types or standardized extensibility.

The following table summarizes the key distinctions between these formats:

_Note: Size and speed comparisons are general tendencies; actual performance depends heavily on data structure, implementation quality, and specific workload._

This comparison highlights that the choice involves navigating a complex web of trade-offs. If strict validation, maximal compactness, and top-tier RPC performance are paramount in a controlled environment where schema management is acceptable, Protocol Buffers is a strong contender. If ensuring robust schema evolution in a large-scale data pipeline is the primary concern, Avro's design offers significant advantages, despite the need for schema distribution mechanisms. For applications tightly integrated with MongoDB, BSON is the natural, albeit specialized, choice. MessagePack provides a popular and often efficient binary alternative to JSON for general network communication, though potential streaming limitations should be considered. CBOR emerges as particularly compelling when IETF standardization, suitability for constrained devices, a flexible yet binary-efficient encoding of the JSON model, standardized extensibility, or the potential for deterministic encoding are key requirements.

## Why Choose CBOR?

Based on the preceding comparisons, CBOR presents a unique combination of features that make it the preferred choice in several specific contexts:

1. **JSON Data Model Fidelity in Binary:** CBOR provides a direct binary encoding for the familiar JSON data model (supporting null, booleans, numbers, strings, arrays, and maps). This lowers the adoption barrier for developers already comfortable with JSON, unlike formats requiring different structural concepts or mandatory schemas.

2. **Efficiency for Constrained Environments:** CBOR was explicitly designed with the Internet of Things (IoT) and other constrained environments in mind. This translates to a specification that enables encoders and decoders with small code footprints (low memory usage) and efficient processing (low CPU and energy consumption), which is critical for resource-limited devices. It also achieves significant message size reduction compared to JSON, conserving bandwidth on constrained networks.

3. **IETF Standardization and Integration:** As an IETF standard (RFC 8949), CBOR benefits from rigorous review and a stable specification. This facilitates its adoption and integration within the broader internet protocol ecosystem. It is used as a payload format in the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) and forms the basis of COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption), which is crucial for security in constrained environments and used in standards like WebAuthn.

4. **Standardized Extensibility via Tags:** CBOR includes a well-defined mechanism for extending the basic data model using semantic tags. These tags (e.g., for timestamps, URIs, bignums, regular expressions) can be registered with IANA, providing a standardized way to represent richer semantics. Importantly, basic decoders can often skip tags they don't understand, allowing for extensibility without breaking backward compatibility or requiring complex version negotiation. This offers a more structured approach than MessagePack's `ext` type.

5. **Schema-Optional Flexibility:** CBOR retains the flexibility of JSON by being schema-optional. Data is self-describing, allowing for parsing without a predefined schema, which is advantageous for evolving systems or ad-hoc data exchange. When structure validation is needed, external schema languages like CDDL (Concise Data Definition Language, RFC 8610) can be employed optionally. This contrasts with the mandatory schema requirements of Protocol Buffers and Avro.

6. **Native Binary Data Support:** Like other binary formats, CBOR includes a native byte string type, allowing efficient representation of binary data without resorting to inefficient text encodings like Base64 required by JSON.

7. **Deterministic Encoding Potential:** The CBOR standard (RFC 8949 Section 4.2) explicitly defines rules for deterministic encoding. This ensures that the same data structure always serializes to the exact same byte sequence, which is critical for cryptographic applications like hashing, digital signatures, and content-addressable storage where reproducibility is essential.

While CBOR offers these advantages, it's important to acknowledge its trade-offs. It is not human-readable, unlike JSON. In high-performance RPC scenarios where schemas are fixed and known, highly optimized Protobuf implementations might offer better raw speed or slightly smaller size. Although its ecosystem is robust and growing, particularly in the IoT and security domains, it might not have the sheer breadth of tooling or library maturity found for JSON or Protobuf in every general-purpose application area.

Ultimately, CBOR occupies a compelling position in the serialization landscape. It provides a standardized, extensible, and efficient binary format built upon the widely understood JSON data model. Its design considerations for constrained environments, integration with IETF protocols, and defined support for deterministic encoding make it particularly well-suited for the modern challenges of the Internet of Things, secure communication, and applications requiring verifiable data structures, all without imposing the rigidity of mandatory schemas found in formats like Protocol Buffers or Avro.

## CBOR as a Foundation for Blockchain Commons

The work undertaken by Blockchain Commons, particularly on specifications like dCBOR (Deterministic CBOR) and the Gordian Envelope structured data format, leverages CBOR as a foundational technology. A primary driver for this choice was the critical need for **determinism** in their applications.

Gordian Envelope, designed as a format for "smart documents" often containing sensitive cryptographic material like keys or verifiable credentials, relies heavily on cryptographic hashing (e.g., in its Merkle-like digest tree) to ensure data integrity and enable features like selective disclosure. For these cryptographic hashes to be consistent and verifiable across different systems and implementations, the underlying data serialization _must_ be deterministic: the exact same semantic data must always produce the identical byte sequence when encoded.

CBOR stands out because its core specification, RFC 8949, explicitly defines a profile for "Deterministically Encoded CBOR". This profile includes rules such as requiring the shortest possible ("preferred") encoding for integers and floating-point numbers, and mandating lexicographical ordering of keys in maps. This built-in, standardized support for deterministic encoding provided a crucial advantage over formats like JSON, which lacks a universally adopted canonicalization standard and often requires complex, potentially error-prone post-processing to achieve determinism, or other binary formats where determinism might not be a primary design goal or is left entirely to the implementation.

While RFC 8949 laid the groundwork, Blockchain Commons identified that it still left some choices open to implementers, potentially leading to inconsistencies even when following the deterministic profile. To achieve the rigorous level of interoperable determinism required for their use cases, they developed a more specific **dCBOR application profile**, documented in an IETF Internet-Draft. This profile further narrows the rules defined in RFC 8949 and the related CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE) draft, addressing specifics like the handling of duplicate map keys (rejecting them) and defining precise rules for numeric reduction (e.g., ensuring 10, 10.0, and 10.00 encode identically).

Beyond the critical requirement for determinism, other CBOR features aligned well with Blockchain Commons' goals, including its nature as a structured binary format suitable for cryptographic data, its conciseness, its standardized extensibility via tags, its status as an IETF standard facilitating adoption, its suitability for constrained environments (relevant for hardware wallets), and its platform independence.

In essence, CBOR provided the necessary standardized foundation for deterministic encoding, which Blockchain Commons then refined through the dCBOR profile to build higher-level secure and interoperable systems like the Gordian Envelope. The specifics of dCBOR and Gordian Envelope are subjects for later chapters in this book.

## Conclusion: A Diverse Binary Ecosystem

The journey from XML's text-based structure to the various binary formats like BSON, Protocol Buffers, MessagePack, Avro, and CBOR reveals a dynamic and evolving landscape for data representation. It underscores the fact that there is no single "best" data serialization format. Each format we've examined represents a set of design choices and trade-offs optimized for particular goals and contexts.

- **BSON** prioritizes efficient storage and traversal within the MongoDB database environment, extending JSON with specific types at the cost of some compactness and general interoperability.
- **Protocol Buffers** achieves high performance and compactness for RPC by mandating schemas and code generation, sacrificing flexibility and self-description.
- **MessagePack** offers a popular, often compact and fast binary alternative to JSON, primarily targeting network communication, though with potential streaming limitations.
- **Avro** excels at managing schema evolution in large-scale data pipelines, requiring schema availability for reads but providing robust compatibility features.
- **CBOR** provides an IETF-standardized, binary-efficient encoding of the familiar JSON data model, balancing flexibility with performance, offering standardized extensibility, and catering particularly well to constrained environments and applications demanding deterministic encoding.

The future likely involves the continued coexistence of these diverse formats, with developers selecting the tool that best fits the unique constraints and objectives of their project. CBOR's position as a versatile, standardized, and efficient format grounded in the JSON model ensures its continued relevance, especially in the growing domains of IoT, secure systems, and verifiable data structures.
